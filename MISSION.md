# Team Mission

**Goal:** Build PORTFOLIO of 10-20 micro-products generating 20-100k SEK/mån

**Started:** 2026-02-15  
**Deadline:** First 3 products shipped by 2026-03-17 (30 days)  
**Strategy:** Not 1 Volvo-project → 100 small ideas, agents drive passively

**Philosophy (2026-02-15 17:32):**
- **Diversification:** 10-20 products × 2-5k SEK/mån = 20-100k total
- **Automation-first:** Agents run operations, Daniel builds MVPs only
- **Speed wins:** Decide → Build → Ship → SEO → Repeat (days, not months)
- **Portfolio approach:** Risk spread across many products, not betting on one

**Example portfolio:**
- EU compliance checker (299 SEK/mån × 50) = 15k/mån
- LinkedIn pain scanner (149 SEK/mån × 100) = 15k/mån  
- Meeting→Tasks (99 SEK/mån × 200) = 20k/mån
- Kvitto→Skatt (199 SEK/mån × 50) = 10k/mån
**= 60k SEK/mån from 4 products, all automated**

## Success Criteria PER PRODUCT

A product is worth building if:

✅ **MVP buildable in 3-7 days**  
✅ **Launch cost <5k SEK** (Vercel free tier + domain)  
✅ **Target revenue: 2-5k SEK/mån** (not 50k - keep it small)  
✅ **Agent-drivable** (billing, support, monitoring automated)  
✅ **TAM >200 customers** (Sweden-fokus OK)  
✅ **Shippable on Vercel** (NextJS + AI + Supabase free tier)

## Current Status (Updated Daily)

**Ideas Tested:** 15  
**Ideas Killed:** 15  
**Ideas "Maybe":** 0  
**Days Remaining:** 30

**Win Rate:** 0% (but learning fast)

## Focus This Week (2026-02-15 → 2026-02-22)

**Theme:** EU directives 2026 + AI compliance automation

**Primary:** Lönetransparensdirektiv (pay transparency)
**Secondary:** Other EU directives going live 2026 (AI Act, CSRD, supply chain, GDPR updates)

**Pattern to exploit:**
- EU directive = forced compliance (companies MUST do it)
- Traditional solution = expensive consultants (10k-100k SEK)
- AI solution = "Software + AI sköter den" (299-999 SEK/mån SaaS)
- Tech stack: Vercel + NextJS + AI (Gemini/Claude) + Supabase (free tier)

**Avoid:**
- Equipment/Fleet/Vehicle maintenance tracking (tested 2x, killed 2x)
- Invoice automation (red ocean, Fortnox/Visma dominant)
- Anything Fortnox can build in <1 month
- Ideas that can't ship on Vercel (avoid infrastructure complexity)

**Explore:**
- EU directive databases + implementation deadlines
- HR compliance subreddits (r/humanresources, r/AskHR)
- Sustainability compliance (CSRD = every large company)
- AI regulation compliance (AI Act = new territory)

## Team Composition

**Scout** - Explorer  
- Role: Find 10-15 ideas/day with quick kill-tests
- Strength: Pattern recognition, broad sweep
- Weakness: Too optimistic on pricing/TAM

**Analyst** - Calculator  
- Role: Validate ideas with numbers (break-even, ROI, margins)
- Strength: Conservative estimates, competitor research
- Weakness: Can miss free alternatives

**Skeptiker** - Risk Assessor  
- Role: Find holes in reasoning, challenge assumptions
- Strength: Finding what others miss (free competitors, risks)
- Weakness: Can be too pessimistic (needs balance)

---

## Decision Framework

**Scout proposes** → **Analyst validates** → **Skeptiker challenges** → **Team decides**

**Autonomy principle (2026-02-15):**
- Team evaluates ideas independently
- Alice coordinates and drives execution
- Daniel involved ONLY at financial decision points (spend/commit)
- Team owns go/no-go/maybe decisions

**Outcome options:**
1. **GO** - All three agree, or 2/3 with strong reasoning → Team Debrief builds scope + budget → Daniel approves spend
2. **NO-GO** - Any critical flaw (free competitor, Fortnox risk, etc) → KILL immediately
3. **MAYBE** - Needs more research (park for later)

**Current rule:** If Skeptiker says NO-GO with evidence → KILL immediately. Don't waste time.

## Progress Tracking

### Week 1 (2026-02-15 → 2026-02-22)

| Date | Scout Ideas | Analyst GO | Skeptiker KILL | Result |
|------|-------------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| 2026-02-14 | 5 (Equipment, Fleet, Invoice) | 3 GO | 3 KILL | 0 survivors |
| 2026-02-15 | 1 (Equipment v2) | 1 GO | 1 KILL | 0 survivors |
| 2026-02-16 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |

**Insight:** Agents learning from mistakes. Expect better ideas as LEARNINGS.md grows.

## Milestones

- [ ] **Day 7:** First "MAYBE" idea (worth deeper research)
- [ ] **Day 14:** First "GO" idea that survives Skeptiker
- [ ] **Day 21:** MVP built and tested
- [ ] **Day 30:** Decision: launch or pivot

## Budget Allocation (10k SEK)

**Remaining:** 10 000 SEK  
**Spent:** 0 SEK

**Reserved for:**
- MVP development: 2 000 - 5 000 SEK
- Marketing test: 2 000 - 3 000 SEK
- Tools/services: 500 - 2 000 SEK
- Buffer: 2 000 - 3 000 SEK

## Communication Cadence

**Daily:**
- 06:00 - Scout research
- 10:00 - Analyst review
- 12:00 - Skeptiker challenge
- 12:30 - Team Debrief (learning session)

**Weekly (Sundays):**
- Review: What did we learn this week?
- Adjust: Are we looking in the right places?
- Decide: Continue or pivot strategy?

## Philosophy

**"Tråkigt = pengar. Roligt = energi. Vi behöver båda."**

- Focus on boring problems that people pay to solve
- Quick kill-tests (30 sec Google) before deep analysis
- Learn from every failure
- One good idea > 100 mediocre ideas

**Kill Your Darlings:**
- Max 3 active explorations at once
- 4h POC timebox, 1 week validation
- No traction → KILL, next idea
- "But if we just tweak..." = RED FLAG (8.5→5.0 never again)
