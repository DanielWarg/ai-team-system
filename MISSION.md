✅ **Launch cost <5k SEK**  
✅ **ROI >50% within 90 days** (15k SEK return minimum)  
✅ **Passive operation** (<30 min/day maintenance)

## Focus This Week (2026-02-15 → 2026-02-22)

**Theme:** Broad Reddit sweep for problems + small profitable things people already do

**Avoid:**
- Equipment/Fleet/Vehicle maintenance tracking (tested 2x, killed 2x)
- Invoice automation (red ocean, Fortnox/Visma dominant)
- Anything Fortnox can build in <1 month

**Explore:**
- r/smallbusiness, r/Entrepreneur, r/sweatystartup
- r/SideProject, r/IMadeThis (people making money)
- r/RealEstate, r/Landlord, r/freelance, r/Accounting
- "Plastbit på snöret" opportunities (simple tools, 99-299 SEK/mån)

## Team Composition

**Scout** - Explorer  
- Role: Find 10-15 ideas/day with quick kill-tests
- Strength: Pattern recognition, broad sweep
- Weakness: Too optimistic on pricing/TAM

**Analyst** - Calculator  
- Role: Validate ideas with numbers (break-even, ROI, margins)
- Strength: Conservative estimates, competitor research
- Weakness: Can miss free alternatives

**Skeptiker** - Risk Assessor  
- Role: Find holes in reasoning, challenge assumptions
- Strength: Finding what others miss (free competitors, risks)
- Weakness: Can be too pessimistic (needs balance)

---

## Decision Framework

**Scout proposes** → **Analyst validates** → **Skeptiker challenges** → **Team decides**

**Autonomy principle (2026-02-15):**
- Team evaluates ideas independently
- Alice coordinates and drives execution
- Daniel involved ONLY at financial decision points (spend/commit)
- Team owns go/no-go/maybe decisions

**Outcome options:**
1. **GO** - All three agree, or 2/3 with strong reasoning → Team Debrief builds scope + budget → Daniel approves spend
2. **NO-GO** - Any critical flaw (free competitor, Fortnox risk, etc) → KILL immediately
3. **MAYBE** - Needs more research (park for later)

**Current rule:** If Skeptiker says NO-GO with evidence → KILL immediately. Don't waste time.

## Progress Tracking

### Week 1 (2026-02-15 → 2026-02-22)

| Date | Scout Ideas | Analyst GO | Skeptiker KILL | Result |
|------|-------------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| 2026-02-14 | 5 (Equipment, Fleet, Invoice) | 3 GO | 3 KILL | 0 survivors |
| 2026-02-15 | 1 (Equipment v2) | 1 GO | 1 KILL | 0 survivors |

## Milestones

- [ ] **Day 14:** First "GO" idea that survives Skeptiker
- [ ] **Day 21:** MVP built and tested
- [ ] **Day 30:** Decision: launch or pivot

## Budget Allocation (10k SEK)

**Remaining:** 10 000 SEK  
**Spent:** 0 SEK

**Reserved for:**
- MVP development: 2 000 - 5 000 SEK
- Marketing test: 2 000 - 3 000 SEK
- Tools/services: 500 - 2 000 SEK
- Buffer: 2 000 - 3 000 SEK

## Communication Cadence

**Daily:**
- 06:00 - Scout research
- 10:00 - Analyst review
- 12:00 - Skeptiker challenge
- 12:30 - Team Debrief (learning session)

**Weekly (Sundays):**
- Review: What did we learn this week?

## Philosophy

**"Tråkigt = pengar. Roligt = energi. Vi behöver båda."**

- Focus on boring problems that people pay to solve
- Quick kill-tests (30 sec Google) before deep analysis
- Learn from every failure
- One good idea > 100 mediocre ideas

**Kill Your Darlings:**
- Max 3 active explorations at once
- 4h POC timebox, 1 week validation
- No traction → KILL, next idea
- "But if we just tweak..." = RED FLAG (8.5→5.0 never again)
